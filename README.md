#	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
To interpret user needs can be done by conducting a focus group or survey, and see how they like the user interface, and features they would like to see implemented. The user stories help by creating a simplified description of the requirement the user has expressed.
